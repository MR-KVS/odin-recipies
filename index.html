    <p>The majority of us love to cook or at least try to cook some food, perhaps daily or on special occasions. We do keep recipes, some in the papers, some have organized books, some scribbled it on a convenient place like kitchen boards, some just permanently place them on their brains. </p>
    <br>
    <b>Cooking is an art, food gratifies the audience when we cook with a secret ingredient called “Love”.</b>
